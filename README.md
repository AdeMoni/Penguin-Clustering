# 🐧 Penguin Clustering
This repo contains code that applies K-Means clustering to the **Penguins dataset** to explore natural groupings among penguin species based on their physical features. 

## 🚀 Project Summary
**Key steps:**
1. Load and explore the dataset.  
2. Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables).  
3. Scale features for consistent model performance.  
4. Apply **K-Means clustering** and determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.  
5. Visualize clusters and interpret insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.8+**
- `pandas` – data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` – visualization  
- `scikit-learn` – clustering and preprocessing

## 📂 Dataset
The _Clustering Penguins Species_ dataset was used for this project, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/youssefaboelwafa/clustering-penguins-species)
